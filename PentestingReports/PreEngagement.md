# Pre-engagement: 
Help yourself to get your 1st Pentesting client and prepare yourself for client meeting?

## UNDERSTAND THE TARGET:
  
    Tester: You need to work to understand the target to design a better test
    Testees: You need to understand yourself so you can steer the test and design
    Recipients: What do you want from the test? What kind of output?

      Best Advise : NEVER ASSUME - Ask the dumb question
      eg :
        “I can guess, but I don’t like to be wrong, so can
        you describe for     me what data or process if lost,
        destroyed, stolen, or leaked would cause the
        greatest damage to your organization?”

## Understanding will help you tailor the test and test results

    Why is the test being done? Compliance? Improved posture?
    Who is the audience?
    What are the security goals?
    What are the security initiatives?
    What are the *biggest risks* to the org?
    You need to identify the goals of pentesting and BUSINESS RISK of client.

## WHAT IS NEEDED TO TEST?
Organizational goals will define the test.
Sometimes the test type is the first point, sometimes it is scope. 
It all depends on the goals and background information.
   
   1. Scope
   2. Types of tests
    And  Rules of engagement

### TEST TYPES
    
    Internal Network
    External Network
    Assumed Breach
    Egress & C2 testing
    Red Team
    Purple Team
    Phishing
    Social Engineering
    Web App & API testing
    Mobile App pen testing
    Wireless pen testing
    Hardware pentesting
    Many others...
    
## SCOPE :

    What is in scope? – This determines time (and cost)
    What is out of scope?
      Yes, this is the same question, but ask it too and 
      you will get extra information
      Why is it out of scope?
    What is owned by someone else?
   
## RULES OF ENGAGMENT

    What can *testers do* without additional permission?
    What should *testers not do* without additional permission?
    Usually pretty simple, simple enough to be a simple list
      Pre-approve engagement potentially are more dangerous attacks, such as password guessing.
      All other "riskier/ENGAGMENT" things need approval.
      
  ### CAN THINGS GO WRONG? - answer is YES.
  
       Most common Systems crash on their own and there is an increased risk with atypical traffic.
          Does it happen all the time? No
          Can it? Of course
       Never guarantee 100% uptime, because no SLAs are 100%
       And Learn from mistakes (redsiege.com/askus)       
 
 ### OTHER THINGS TO PLAN (In case you have team of pentesters or running a company)
      
      Contact numbers for testers and target, including backups
      Secure communication methods
      Regular discussion times on longer tests
      For longer create follow up tamplete to keep up with clients.
      Advice for ORG: Always ROTATE TESTING in ORGS. 
      If you never rotate, you will go out of business almost immediately.
      
      For indivisual pentester:
      Don't be affered to approch the ORGS for TESTING.
      ORGS Maybe looking for different testers after a certain time.

## If you are the Bringing out the clients for organization
    
    0. As a Tester, you need to understand Attackers have a near infinite amount of time
       No one is going to pay an infinite amount of money*
       So Set a realistic duration to get optimal results.
    1. Clients may just ask you to conduct pen test and don't know all the technical details and expect a good test.
       It's your Job is to teach test types and understand there requirenment by asking the righ questions, not shame them.
    2. Testers need to be available for outages, questions, or external compromise.
    3. Testers must Know your procurement process! and know their holiday schedule!
    4. If the target doesn't improve their security posture, you have been a waste of time.
    
### IF YOU ARE THE REPORT RECIPIENT
    Ask for what you want ahead of time 
    eg Some orgs want data in a spreadsheet or CSV , may ask for executive report or developer report etc
    Does the sample report have the info you want or need?
    Use the pen testers! Setup a debrief call to go through the report if you need it!
