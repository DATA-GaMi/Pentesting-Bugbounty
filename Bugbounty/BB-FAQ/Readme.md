##### For every bug bounty hunter, keep these things in mind when you are reporting any vulnerability

- 1-Report should have all the necessary details including vulnerable url(most imp), reproducing steps ,poc, impact and if possible mitigation steps.

- 2-When you are explaining impact of any vulnerability , don’t just tell them i can steal session cookie and do account takeover, try to do it and the- n report it. Reporting anything and asking for bounty or hall of fame is not worth it at all.

- 3-This is for xss guys, after finding a popup dont report, try to do further exploitation and increase your impact.

- 4-Report multiple vulnerabilities to a company and then approach them to get their vapt done by you , it will help you in future.

- 5-Understand what’s critical for a company and focus on that types of bugs when you are hunting and trust me it will save your time for sure and you won’t get demotivated after seeing traiger reply on your bug that they are not applicable or etc etc.
