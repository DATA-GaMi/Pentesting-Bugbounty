### CVE PoC :
  - [CVE-2022-22629 MacOS PoC](https://github.com/parsdefense/CVE-2022-22629)
           
      - Target & Affected Version: **MacOS - Safari <15.4**

      - Target & Affected Version: **Ubuntu 22.04 & Distro**
      - Discription/Issue : A reliable exploit + write-up to elevate privileges to root. (Tested on Ubuntu 22.04) 
    
  - [CVE-2022-40297 PoC](https://github.com/filipkarc/PoC-ubuntutouch-pin-privesc)
    
    - Target & Version : **Ubuntu Touch 16.04**
    - Title : Privilage escalation in Ubuntu Touch 16.04 - by PIN Bruteforce
    - Description : Ubuntu Touch allows you to "protect" devices with a 4-digit passcode. Such a code was set in a demonstration device. The problem is that the same 4-digit passcode then becomes a password that we can use with the sudo command and gain root privileges. This means that a malicious application can do us double harm:
                        1. Easily escalate privileges and take control of the device.
                        2. It can pass the screen unlock passcode to a third party.

  - [CVE-2022-20128 PoC](https://github.com/irsl/CVE-2022-20128)
    
    - Target : **Android Debug Bridge (adb) - directory traversal**

    - Target & Patched Version : **Zimbra released a patched on 8.8.15P31 and 9.0.0P24.**
    - Title : Zimbra Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution Exploit.
    - Description : CVE-2022-27925 was originally listed as an RCE exploit requiring authentication. When combined with a separate bug, however, it became an unauthenticated RCE exploit that made remote exploitation trivial.
 
  - [CVE-2022-37299 Poc](https://vulners.com/cve/CVE-2022-37299)

  - [CVE-2022-25260](https://github.com/yuriisanin/CVE-2022-25260)
  
    - Target & Patched Version : **JetBrains Hub <2021.1.14276**
    - Title : JetBrains Hub pre-auth semi-blind server-side request forgery (SSRF).
    
    - Description : JetBrains Hub before 2021.1.14276 was vulneable to improper access control (CVE-2022-34894), which allows an attacker create untrusted services without authentication even if guest user is disabled. This makes it possible to exploit the vulnerablity without any other requirements (normally an attacker should be at least authenticated). The vulnerability was possible due to use of Apache Batik with default settings for user-supplied SVG icon rasterization.
