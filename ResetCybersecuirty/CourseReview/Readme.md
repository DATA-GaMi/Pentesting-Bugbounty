 Eg : This was my first course in 2019. This was the "intro/beginner" course(Certified Ethical Hacking with Theory based Exam). 
      I took after attending an Webinar about Ethical Hacking. If i have to recall It was quite understanable since 
      I was attending an offline classes twice in a week and my teacher was reall good for a beginner course.
      
      The course provide you a login credentials to the APSEN portal, 3 Ebook that include 2 for theory and 1 lab manual, an exam voucher, 
      and pdf(high quality only for you), Video lecture(average).
      For me lab were at the right level of difficulty but i personally thing if you're getting started and don't have anybackground in cybersecurity
      then you should go for It. Many organizations consider Certified Ethical Hacker certification to be a minimum requirement 
      when looking to appoint someone for a cyber security role. This certification may be exactly what you need to get the recruiter’s attention.
     
     Exam : For CEH exam they give you both option Theory/Practicle so better consult your Trainning institute for this.
     For theory-based Exam, you will have no choice but just memorize – I hated this about the course but easy to crack the exam.
     
     Exam voucher: I think that you have an option to purchase this with your training voucher. 
     Please keep in mind that the voucher is valid for 12 months. The exam must be taken at a certified exam center.
     
     
     
      Final Note:
      Incase you want to advance your Pentesting
      Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), EC-Council Certified Security Analyst (ECSA), Licensed Penetration Tester (LPT), etc will be the Next.
