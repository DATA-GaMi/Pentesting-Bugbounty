#### We started working on "Weekly Infosec Update" because It's very time consuming to monitor the InfoSec Community on twitter, telegram, reddit. discord and visiting security website every day. 
We had no idea we’d end up releasing "Weekly Infosec Update" every Wednesday. Huge thanks to our awesome [Community Leader to contribution and giving back to community](https://github.com/RESETHACKER-COMMUNITY/Pentesting-Bugbounty/blob/main/ResetCybersecuirty/SupportedBy/Readme.md) and thankyou for being the part of team.

Contributors : - Good Resources Share, Paul miller, Tarang Parmar, Tuhin Bose, Vikram and Alexandre ZANNI(@noraj Github Moderator).

### Let's start the Week recap, and my apology for So much Info. We're finding a way to make it shorter.

### ===========  HIRING, WORKSHOP & TRAINNING  ===========

**Here we talk about and share resources related to Jobs, Ongoing Workshop and free trainning offered by organization, community and leader.**

1. Let's Talk about [Internship/Job Opening in Aug 2022.](https://github.com/RESETHACKER-COMMUNITY/Pentesting-Bugbounty/blob/main/CyberSecurityJobs/Jobs.md#Weekly-Cybersecurity-Hiring-Aug-2022) 

2. Here We have collected [Interview Questions asked by organization while Hiring.](https://github.com/RESETHACKER-COMMUNITY/Pentesting-Bugbounty/blob/main/CyberSecurityJobs/InterviewQA.md) 

3. Free SANS Workshop: [Building an Azure Pentest Lab for Red Teams](https://www.sans.org/webcasts/sans-workshop-building-azure-pentest-lab-red-teams/)
### ===========  EVENTS, TALKS & WEBINAR  ===========

**This Week Defcon, BlackHat and Liran Tal talk from JSDayCAN22 was mainly trending in infosec community so We have filtered important Talk, Slides, Tools, Weekly Podcast, Youtube Videos and resources releted to Events, Talks & Webinars.**

 - In case you're still strugling with finding [Blackhat 2022 all the slides.](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1KHx2rKUEdb53flGUN0mFHRdSdB5PUT4B?fbclid=IwAR1C2Fk3XDPU-ky-4B57ZmKtEKgjB6Yg-9m2c6MTxyJd779yPV7MCCHCvWo&fs=e&s=c). This drive have it all. Enjoy :)

 - In BlackHat USA 2022, markakd talked about [DirtyCred - A New Exploitation Method! No Pipe but as Nasty as Dirty Pipe](https://github.com/markakd/DirtyCred)

 - This article is the “text notes” version of @spaceraccoon talk at DEF CON 30 Cloud Village. [Exploiting Improper Validation of Amazon Simple Notification Service SigningCertUrl](https://spaceraccoon.dev/exploiting-improper-validation-amazon-simple-notification-service/) - The talk was not recorded so this is the only public version of it.

 - [How React Applications Get Hacked in the Real-World – Liran Tal](https://youtu.be/f16lELnFTNI) : [Slide](https://slides-react-security-lightning-talk-2022.vercel.app/1) -> By using React we are completely safe when it comes to sanitizing user input right? Liran scarily points out that in fact although React does cover most cases for us, dynamic href attributes are not encoded so can be susceptible to XSS attacks 😱. It’s therefore important that if we are to expose some user input via href we should always prefix the protocol (https://) and use relative paths!
