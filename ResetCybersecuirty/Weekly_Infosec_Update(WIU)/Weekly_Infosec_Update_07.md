#### I'm so grateful to all the [Organization and researchers](https://github.com/RESETHACKER-COMMUNITY/Community-Contributers/blob/main/StayUptoDate.md) without their Writeups, article, findings and whitepaper [Weekly infosec Update](https://github.com/RESETHACKER-COMMUNITY/Community-Contributers/blob/main/StayUptoDate.md) would not have been possible.

#### I'm very grateful to all the [Organization, group, and community that support us for the engagement](https://github.com/RESETHACKER-COMMUNITY/Pentesting-Bugbounty/blob/main/ResetCybersecuirty/SupportedBy/CommunityEngagementPartners.md).
