#### We started working on "Weekly Infosec Update" because It's very time consuming for professional to monitor the InfoSec Community on twitter, telegram, reddit. slack, discord and visiting security website every day. 
We had no idea we’d end up releasing "Weekly Infosec Update" **every Wednesday at 8:00 AM IST.** 

Huge thanks to our awesome [Community Leader to contribution and giving back to community](https://github.com/RESETHACKER-COMMUNITY/Pentesting-Bugbounty/blob/main/ResetCybersecuirty/SupportedBy/Team%26Contributors.md) and thankyou for being the part of team.
