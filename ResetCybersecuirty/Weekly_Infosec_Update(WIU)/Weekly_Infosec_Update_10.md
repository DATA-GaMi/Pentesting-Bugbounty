    - According to Mike P creator of Return on Security, Cybersecurity funding continued its downward trend in Q3 2022.
      > Both overall volume of transactions and total amount of money raised took a hit. What is interesting, however, is that while the total funding volume is down, the average funding round check size is still on par with 2021 to the tune of $29.1M in 2022 compared to $29.8M in 2021. Q4 2021 saw a rebound in transaction volume and money, and based on how October has started, this trend appears to be happening again in 2022.
