- Huge thanks to our awesome [Community Leader for contribution and giving back to community](https://github.com/RESETHACKER-COMMUNITY/Pentesting-Bugbounty/blob/main/ResetCybersecuirty/SupportedBy/Team%26Contributors.md) and thankyou for being the part of team.
   - Contributors : Good Resources Share, Paul miller, Tarang Parmar, Tuhin Bose, Vikram and Alexandre ZANNI.

- I'm very grateful to all the [Organization, group, and community that support us for the engagement](https://github.com/RESETHACKER-COMMUNITY/Pentesting-Bugbounty/blob/main/ResetCybersecuirty/SupportedBy/CommunityEngagementPartners.md). Without their support distributing "Weekly InfoSec Update" among hackers would not have been possible.

- Resources from [Organization and researchers](https://github.com/RESETHACKER-COMMUNITY/Community-Contributers/blob/main/StayUptoDate.md) that help us drafting [Weekly infosec Update](https://github.com/RESETHACKER-COMMUNITY/Community-Contributers/blob/main/StayUptoDate.md).
