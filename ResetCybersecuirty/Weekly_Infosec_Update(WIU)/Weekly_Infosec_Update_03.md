### BlackHat Hacker News:
  - AWAE OSWE Exam Writeup July 2022 has been leaked.(Source : Unknown)
  - üî¥ The Clop ransomware group claimed that it was able to break into Thames Water's industrial control systems and steal 5 terabytes of data, but did not encrypt any data, and although it could change the chemical percentage of water and affect 15 million British people, this It did not work and this company informed about this vulnerability. But the company has denied this claim.

    Further, this ransomware group has published part of the data to prove that by checking it, they realized that this group did not hack Thames Water and in fact they hacked South Staffordshire Water, which of course this company confirmed this hack. (Part of the data is the username and password that belong to this company, i.e. South-Staffs-Water.co.uk@*)

    Based on this, there are two possibilities, either this group's goal is to misidentify or they want to extort money from a big company with the information of this small company.

    Given that Britain is in a drought period and has implemented water rationing policies, the choice of such targets on the part of the attackers can be done to exert pressure to pay the ransom, which is conceivable.
