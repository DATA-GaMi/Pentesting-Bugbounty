## [Weekly_Infosec_Update](https://github.com/RESETHACKER-COMMUNITY/Pentesting-Bugbounty/tree/main/ResetCybersecuirty) Community Engagement Partners.

I'm so grateful to all the Organization, group, and community that support us for the engagement. Without their support reaching out to hackers would not have been possible.
