Hey, main thing I'd change is the structure itself. You have 6 sections. Why not make it 6 separate .md files? 

I honestly don't care about bug bounty or the hiring part. So having to scroll through it is a bit tedious.
If there was a main page with links to each sections, that'd be much better in my opinion. 

Maybe do a very quick introduction to what news are in each section on the main page.
For example:
TWITTER, NEWS & DATA BREACH -> link here
- Samsung data breach
- TikTok possible breach
- ...and more

Then you click on the section and you have all the news from this section in more detail. 

Also THE main thing that should be like NUMBER #1 is new vulnerabilities. 
I'd absolutely love a reliable place I can check every morning to see if there's some new vulnerability that I should be aware of as an engineer. 
New tools, hiring, research, bug bounty reports...all that is nice to know. 
But new vulnerabilities is an absolutely critical thing that every engineer working in cybersecurity has to follow. 

That's my 2 cents, good luck with your project guys!
