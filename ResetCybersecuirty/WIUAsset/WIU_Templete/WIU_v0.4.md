### This week we have made some changes in New version of "Weekly Security Update" v0.4

1. Added nevigation Bar (called SAVE TIME).
So hacker can select the segment and read it without hussle with scrolling.

2. We have Reduce segment from 12  to 7.
And my apology for So much Info. We're finding a way to make it shorter and more user friendly.
