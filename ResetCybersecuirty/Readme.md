**CVE's**

- [fanweiOA #rce POC](https://github.com/xiaoheihei741/fanweiOA-rce-poc)

    CVE-2022-26712: The POC for SIP-Bypass Is Even Tweetable

- I found some new attack surfaces in the macOS PackageKit.framework, and successfully disclosed 15+ critical SIP-Bypass vulnerabilities. Apple has addressed   12 of them with CVE assigned so far. There are still some reports in the Apple’s processing queue. All of them are interesting logic issues, and of course  each has a successful exploit demonstration.

    Here, CVE-2022-26712 is a very simple one, which was patched in macOS 12.4. However, I found another way to exploit it again, finally Apple addressed it as CVE-2022-32826 in macOS 12.5.

**Tools**

- SSTImap - Automatic SSTI detection tool with interactive interface
    SSTImap was developed as a new SSTI detection tool based on Tplmap.The main feature of this tool and 
    a key difference with Tplmap is the interactive mode, which enhances detection and exploitation.Also, 
    payload for Smarty was changed to work without {{php}}{{/php}} tag, which was disabled by default in 
    Smarty 3.0.New payloads for other template engines will be developed.

- GPSJam 
    GPS Interfence Map shows where GPS jamming systems could be operating on a particular day 
    (most often associated with military conflicts).
    Data source: ADS-B Exchange API.

- PurplePanda

    This tool fetches resources from different cloud/saas applications focusing on permissions in order to identify 
    privilege escalation paths and dangerous permissions in the cloud/saas configurations. 
    Note that PurplePanda searches both privileges escalation paths within a platform and across platforms.
    The name comes from the animal Red Panda. This panda eats peas, just like Purple Panda, which can ingest API keys/tokens
    found by these PEASS. The color was changed to purple because this tool is meant mainly for Purple Teams 
    (because it can be highly useful for both Blue and Red Teams).
