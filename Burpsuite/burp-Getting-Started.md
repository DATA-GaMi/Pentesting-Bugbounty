    ○ Sitemap becomes fairly useful when hitting an undocumented API endpoint as this view allows you to build a picture of the possible endpoints. You can also view the HTTP requests in this tab, clicking on a folder in the sitemap will only show requests from that path. 

	
**3.Intruder:**
		
    ○ If you're doing any fuzzing or brute forcing with Burp you're probably doing it in the “intruder” tab. When you find an interesting request right click it then click “Send to Intruder”
		
		  Goto "Intruder" > Click "Clear"> Now from here your steps vary depending on what you're trying to do,
		  Eg: we are trying to do some parameter fuzzing. One of the first things we need to do is select the value we are trying to modify. This can be done by highlighting the value and pressing the “Add” button. Since we are attempting to do parameter fuzzing this is the value that will be replaced with our fuzzing payloads. 
		
		You may have also noticed the “Attack type” drop down menu is set to “Sniper”, there are four different attack types which are described in the table below: 
			i. Sniper Uses a single payload list; Replaces one position at a time; 
			ii. Battering ram Uses a single payload list; Replaces all positions at the same time; Once you have selected your attack type and the value to be modified click on the “Payloads” sub tab as shown below: 
			iii. Pitchfork Each position has a corresponding payload list; So if there are two positions to be modified they each get their own payload list. 
			iv. Cluster Bomb Uses each payload list and tires different combinations for each position.
		Once you have selected your attack type and the value to be modified click on the “Payloads” sub tab.Here we want to select our payload type and the payload list. 
		As for my payload list we want a list of fuzzing values. For this example im just going to use the default lists that comes with Burp but there are some other good lists on SecLists: 
		● https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Fuzzing
		Now to use Burps pre defined list just click the “Add from list” drop down menu and select one.
		Now that you have your fuzzing list imported all that you have to do is press “Start attack”.
		The next step is to inspect the HTTP responses to determine if there is anything suspicious. However, most professionals don't use intruder, they use a plugin called “Turbo Intruder”
	
**4.Repeater:**
     
     ○ Repeater modify and replay and request you do it in the repeater tab. the request to test for vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations.
	   You might have noticed that at the top there are a bunch of different tabs with numbers on them. By default every request you send to the repeater will be assigned a number. Whenever I find something interesting I change this value so I can easily find it later, that's why one of the tabs is labeled SSRF,it’s a quick easy way to keep a record of things. 
	

**5.Burp Collaborator:**

      ○ A network service which helps to discover blind vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XML injection, cross-site scripting, code enjection  etc
