      Applying session handling & macro to a 3rd party tool (Sqlmap) and excluding a cookie value from the altering. 
      Note that I just used the profile endpoint and the /login RESTful api for testing purposes.

      Deploying Private BurpSuite Collaborator in AWS EC2 Instance (Automated).

      Creating sequences of requests/steps using BurpSuite extension #Stepper.
      Another #Tip: 
      No need to be an expert in #RegEx to use Stepper, just use BurpSuite Sequencer (Select! Then copy the RegEx) 
      BUT it's good to know RegEx ofc!

       A short but valuable tip when it comes to automation!
       Generating scripts such as Python, cURL, PowerShell and other scripting languages to reissue a selected HTTP request.

      Now you can match responses based on specific conditions and push the matched strings/body to your slack/custom server.
      – Customize the push notification
      – Timer
      – Match all the callbacks.
