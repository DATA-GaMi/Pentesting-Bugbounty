Note : Each of these disciplines,depicted in figure 2.1, categorizes numerous job roles that are constantly evolving and changing. 

          Security operations (SOC TEAM)
          Digital forensics and incident response (DFIR)
          Security architecture and design
          Security assessment and verification (Vulnerability assisments, pentesting red teaming etc)
          Application, software, and product security
          Governance and compliance
          Education and awareness
          Sales and sales support
          Leaders and executives
          

**Security operations**(people on the cybersecurity front lines):

  The skill sets of these people tend to be wide ranging as theyâ€™re ultimately responsible for maintaining security
  posture across all technologies within an organization. The responsibilities within security operations therefore are
  wide reaching. At the core of security operations is typically the security operations center (SOC). 
  The function of the security operations center (SOC) is to monitor, prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to 
  cyber threats around the clock. SOC teams are also charged with monitoring and protecting the organization's assets including
  intellectual property, personnel data, business systems,and brand integrity.

  The security operations role also interfaces with many of the other roles that we will discuss. For instance, 
  when an alerted event turns out to be an attack, they may need to engage the incident response team to provide 
  a more sophisticated response to the problem (more on that soon). They also need to be aware of the current threat landscape,
  because receiving regular information from threat intelligence resources is crucial.

Advice:
      
      For many who are looking to begin a career in cybersecurity,Security operations is where they start. Security operations
      roles often work with automated systems and repeatable tasks that lend themselves well to on-the-job learning and training. 
      Additionally, individuals in these roles can easily leverage previous IT experience in their daily job functions.

      Finally, because of the nature of the role and the wide-ranging responsibilities over various forms of technology,
      security operations is a terrific way to gain exposure to a lot of the technologies and concepts that the cybersecuirty 
      teams are charged with defending.
      
      
**Digital forensics and incident response (DIFR)** that focuses on the identification, investigation, and remediation of cyberattacks.
DFIR has two main components:

    Digital Forensics: A subset of forensic science that examines system data, user activity, and other pieces of digital evidence
                        to determine if an attack is in progress and who may be behind the activity.
    Incident Response: The overarching process that an organization will follow in order to prepare for, detect, contain, and recover from a data breach.
    
Whereas the SOC is responsible for evaluating potential incoming attacks and taking initial steps to defend against
them, they will typically escalate to incident response(IR) personnel if a more coordinated and specialized level of
response is needed or if the breadth of the attack involves extensive portions of the environment.
