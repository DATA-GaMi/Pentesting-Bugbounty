## 1. Internship (Advise : https://github.com/iamthefrogy)
Shall I go for an internship in any company after my study?

Will it be helpful in my career?

What kind of internship do companies provide?

Is it necessary to do it from a renowned company or any company?

The answer to this question is too broad. It depends on many factors such as:
 
• Which company is providing Internship (Product based company, security consulting company, Big4 etc.?)

• What are their requirements for internship programs?

• What will be the job roles and responsibilities during the internship?

• What are the expectations from an employer?

There are very few; I would say only a handful of companies that provide quality internships where you would learn valuable things. Most of the money-
making companies are running CEH (Certified ethical hacker – Which is the official certification from EC-Council, a well-reputed cybersecurity certification
authority) and related courses on the name of an internship. For example, if my company's name is Prakash, then I will provide my own CEH certification in
the name of "PCEH – Prakash Certified Ethical Hacker" and so on.

- So, I have prepared 'DO' and 'DON'T' for selecting a company for your internship

## DO

• Understand the nature of a company (consulting, product-based, small, big, etc.).

• Ask them about your daily responsibilities, tasks, and job routines.

• Ask them what the learning options are they can provide to you during your internship.

• Ask them what their expectations from you during the duration of the internship will be.

• Ask more and more people around for the reviews of those companies you are evaluating for internships.

• Identify your career interests. This could be done by self-reflection, speaking with a Career Counsellor or your mentor

• Ask the company about paid or unpaid Internships. You can go for any as far as other criteria are matched.

• Start searching for an internship at least 6 months prior.

• If you are interested in any company and can't find any internship opportunity, you can check their website and social media. Connect to their HRs via

• LinkedIn and ask the same.

• Better understand and research who they are, what they do, their strengths and weaknesses

• Perform at least 5 mock interviews with your career counsellor or mentor before going for an internship interview.

## DON'T

• Don't select a company that just provides course teaching, coaching.

• Don't select a company that do not serve any clients or serve any handful of clients only with simple projects.

• Don't select a company that asks you to teach their students via their coaching, training programs.

• Don't get attracted by any company's marketing & PR success.

• Don't get attracted by their company's reputation through magazines, press, awards from random conferences or panels.

• Don't select a company where only 4/5 people are working; all are Founders, Co-Founders, Directors. If you do, please check their professional

• background. Check whether they obtained these titles without having any prior corporate experience or started their start-ups after having at least 8
years of experience in the industry
