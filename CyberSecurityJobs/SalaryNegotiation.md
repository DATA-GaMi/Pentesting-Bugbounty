NOTE: Percentage of people that don't negotiate their salary are very high but If everything goes really smooth then you should negotiation it.

For Salary negotiation After hearing the offer form HR just maintain the silence for 10-15 Sec or It will be best if HR say something. 
Then Thank them and Always add atleast 10% more from the offered salary or Based on market value or expected salary.

-> HR Says NO or Making excuse (Don't worry)
I was expecting b/w 12 Laks to 15 Lakhs. (give them hint)

-> If HR still says No then 
Ask for Sign on bonus?
"Do you have **Sign on bonus** that will help me a lot and It'll maintan the Gap between offered salary and expected salary.

-> Still No or you have already an offer 
Speak cleary, What you want ? and tell them about the offer.

-> Still no then 
Give them the time or ask for the time period.

You'll get in middle for sure or may be you'll get your expected salary.
